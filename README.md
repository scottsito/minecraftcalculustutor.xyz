# My Minecraft Server Website

This is a small static site inspired by the look of 6b6t to showcase server features.

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open).
- Edit the server IP in `index.html` (search for `play.example.org`) to your real server IP.
- Customize the text and features as needed.

Notes
- This is a minimal starting point (HTML + CSS). No build tools required.
